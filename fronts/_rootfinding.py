    Find an interval that brackets a root of a function by searching in one
    direction.

    Starting from an interval, it moves and extends the interval in the
    direction of the second endpoint until the interval brackets a root of the
    given function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable
        Continuous scalar function.
    interval : sequence of two floats
        Starting interval. Must have non-equal endpoints. It is not necessary
        that ``interval[0] < interval[1]``.
    growth_factor : float, optional
        How much to grow the length of the interval in each iteration.
    maxiter : int or None, optional
        Maximum number of iterations. Must be nonnegative. An
        `IterationLimitReached` exception will be raised if the bracket is not
        found within the specified number of iterations. If `None`, there is no
        maximum number of iterations.
    f_interval : sequence of two of {None, float}, optional
        Values of `f` at the interval endpoints, if known (`None` if a value is
        not known). For every known value, an additional call to `f` will be
        avoided.
    ftol : None or float
        An optional absolute tolerance for the value of `f` at a root. If
        given, the algorithm will immediately return any root it happens to
        discover in its execution.

    Returns
    -------
    result : Result
        Normally contains a bracket and no root. However, if `ftol` is not
        `None` and a root is found, it will contain that root. In this case,
        the result may or may not include a bracket for that root.

    Notes
    -----
    If `ftol` is not `None` and both endpoints of the starting interval qualify
    as roots, the one where the absolute value of `f` is lower is chosen as the
    root.

    Find root of a function within a bracket using the bisection method.

    Compared to SciPy's `scipy.optimize.bisect` function, this function defines
    convergence with respect to the residual (i.e., the value of `f` when
    evaluated at the found approximate root).

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable
        Continuous scalar function.
    bracket: sequence of two floats
        An interval bracketing a root. `f` must have different signs at the two
        endpoints, or a `NotABracketError` will be raised. It is not necessary
        that ``bracket[0] < bracket[1]``.
    ftol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance for the value of `f` at the root. Must be
        nonnegative.
    maxiter : int or None, optional
        Maximum number of iterations. Must be nonnegative. An
        `IterationLimitReached` exception will be raised if the specified
        tolerance is not achieved within this number of iterations. If `None`,
        there is no maximum number of iterations.

        value is not known). For every known value, an additional call to `f`

    Returns
    -------
    result : Result
        Contains the root and the final bracket.

    Notes
    -----
    The function starts by testing the endpoints of the bracket. If a root is
    found at one of the endpoints of a valid bracket, no bisection iterations
    are performed and the root is immediately returned. If both endpoints
    qualify as roots, the one where the absolute value of `f` is lower is
    returned.
