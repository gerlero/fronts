class SemiInfiniteSolution(Solution):
    r"""
    Continuous solution to a semi-infinite problem.

    Its methods describe a continuous solution to a problem of finding a
    function `S` of `r` and `t` such that:

    .. math::
         \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial t} = \nabla\cdot\left[D\left(S\right)
                        \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial r}\mathbf{\hat{r}}\right]

    with `r` bounded at :math:`r_b(t)=o_b\sqrt t` on the left and unbounded to
    the right. For :math:`r<r_b(t)`, the methods will evaluate to NaNs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sol : callable
        Solution to the corresponding ODE obtained with `ode`. For any `o` in
        the closed interval [`ob`, `oi`], ``sol(o)[0]`` is the value of
        `S` at `o`, and ``sol(o)[1]`` is the value of the derivative
        :math:`dS/do` at `o`. `sol` will only be evaluated in this interval.
    ob : float
        :math:`o_b`, which determines the behavior of the boundary.
    oi : float
        Value of the Boltzmann variable at which the solution can be considered
        to be equal to the initial condition. Must be :math:`\geq o_b`.
    D : callable
        `D` used to obtain `sol`. Must be the same function that was passed to
        `ode`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : callable
        Twice-differentiable function that maps the range of `S` to positive
        values. It can be called as ``D(S)`` to evaluate it at `S`. It can
        also be called as ``D(S, n)`` with `n` equal to 1 or 2, in which case
        the first `n` derivatives of the function evaluated at the same `S` are

        scalar function, `D` operates in a vectorized fashion with the same
        semantics when `S` is a `numpy.ndarray`.
    Si : float
        :math:`S_i`, the initial value of `S` in the domain.
    Sb : float
        :math:`S_b`, the value of `S` imposed at the boundary.
    dS_dob_bracket : (float, float), optional
        Search interval that contains the value of the derivative of `S` with
        respect to the Boltzmann variable `o` (i.e., :math:`dS/do`) at the
        boundary in the solution. The interval can be made as wide as desired,
        at the cost of additional iterations required to obtain the solution.
        To refine a solution obtained previously with this same function, pass
        in that solution's final `dS_dob_bracket`. This parameter is always
        checked and a `ValueError` is raised if a `dS_dob_bracket` is found not
        to be valid for the problem.
    radial : {False, 'cylindrical', 'spherical'}, optional
        Choice of coordinate unit vector :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}`. Must be one
        of the following:

            * `False` (default)
                :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}` is any coordinate unit vector in
                rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates, or an axial unit vector in
                a cylindrical coordinate system
            * ``'cylindrical'``
                :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}` is the radial unit vector in a
                cylindrical coordinate system
            * ``'spherical'``
                :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}` is the radial unit vector in a
                spherical coordinate system
    ob : float, optional
        :math:`o_b`, which determines the behavior of the boundary. The default
        is zero, which implies that the boundary always exists at :math:`r=0`.
        It must be strictly positive if `radial` is not `False`. Be aware that
        a non-zero value implies a moving boundary.
    Si_tol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance for :math:`S_i`.
    maxiter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations. A `RuntimeError` will be raised if the
        specified tolerance is not achieved within this number of iterations.
        Must be >= 2.
    verbose : {0, 1, 2}, optional
        Level of algorithm's verbosity. Must be one of the following:

            * 0 (default) : work silently.
            * 1 : display a termination report.
            * 2 : display progress during iterations.

                Subinterval of `dS_dob_bracket` that contains the value of
                :math:`dS/do` at the boundary in the solution. May be used in a
                subsequent call with a smaller `Si_tol` to avoid reduntant

    Notes
    -----
    Given the expression of :math:`r_b` which specifies the location of the
    boundary, a fixed boundary can be had only if :math:`o_b=0`. Any other
    :math:`o_b` implies a moving boundary. This restriction affects radial
    problems in particular.

    This function works by transforming the partial differential equation with
    the Boltzmann transformation using `ode` and then solving the resulting ODE
    repeateadly using the 'Radau' method as implemented in
    `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`. The boundary condition is satisfied exactly as
    the starting point, and the algorithm iterates with different values of
    :math:`dS/do` at the boundary (chosen from within `dS_dob_bracket` using
    bisection) until it finds the solution that also satisfies the initial
    condition with the specified tolerance. This scheme assumes that
    :math:`dS/do` at the boundary varies continuously with :math:`S_i`.

    r"""
    Solve an instance of the general problem starting from a guess of the
    solution.

    Given a positive function `D`, scalars :math:`S_i`, :math:`S_b` and
    :math:`o_b`, and coordinate unit vector :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}`, finds a
    function `S` of `r` and `t` such that:

    .. math:: \begin{cases} \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial t} =
        \nabla\cdot\left[D\left(S\right)\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial r}

        S(r_b(t), t) = S_b & t>0 \\
        r_b(t) = o_b\sqrt t
        \end{cases}

    This function requires an initial mesh and guess of the solution. It is
    significantly less robust than `solve`, and will fail to converge in many
    cases that the latter can easily handle (whether it converges will usually
    depend heavily on the problem, the initial mesh and the guess of the
    solution; it will raise a `RuntimeError` on failure). However, when it
    converges it is usually faster than `solve`, which may be an advantage for
    some use cases. You should nonetheless prefer `solve` unless you have a
    particular use case for which you have found this function to be better.

    Possible use cases include refining a solution (note that `solve` can do
    that too), optimization runs in which known solutions make good first
    approximations of solutions with similar parameters and every second of
    computing time counts, and in the implementation of other solving
    algorithms. In all these cases, `solve` should probably be used as a
    fallback for when this function fails.

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : callable
        Twice-differentiable function that maps the range of `S` to positive
        values. It can be called as ``D(S)`` to evaluate it at `S`. It can

        scalar function, `D` operates in a vectorized fashion with the same
        semantics when `S` is a `numpy.ndarray`.
    Si : float
        :math:`S_i`, the initial value of `S` in the domain.
    Sb : float
        :math:`S_b`, the value of `S` imposed at the boundary.
    o_guess : numpy.array_like, shape (n_guess,)
        Initial mesh in terms of the Boltzmann variable `o`. Must be strictly
        increasing. ``o_guess[0]`` is :math:`o_b`, which determines the
        behavior of the boundary. If zero, it implies that the boundary always
        exists at :math:`r=0`. It must be strictly positive if `radial` is not
        `False`. Be aware that a non-zero value implies a moving boundary. On
        the other end, ``o_guess[-1]`` must be large enough to contain the
        solution to the semi-infinite problem.
    S_guess : float or numpy.array_like, shape (n_guess,)
        Initial guess of `S` at the points in `o_guess`. If a single value, the
        guess is interpreted as uniform.
    radial : {False, 'cylindrical', 'spherical'}, optional
        Choice of coordinate unit vector :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}`. Must be one
        of the following:

            * `False` (default)
                :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}` is any coordinate unit vector in
                rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates, or an axial unit vector in
                a cylindrical coordinate system
            * ``'cylindrical'``
                :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}` is the radial unit vector in a
                cylindrical coordinate system
            * ``'spherical'``
                :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}` is the radial unit vector in a
                spherical coordinate system
    max_nodes : int, optional
        Maximum allowed number of mesh nodes.
    verbose : {0, 1, 2}, optional
        Level of algorithm's verbosity. Must be one of the following:

            * 0 (default) : work silently.
            * 1 : display a termination report.
            * 2 : display progress during iterations.

    Given that the location of the boundary is expressed in terms of the

    This function works by transforming the partial differential equation with

    with SciPy's boundary value problem solver `scipy.integrate.solve_bvp` and
    a two-point Dirichlet condition that matches the boundary and initial
    conditions of the problem. Upon that solver's convergence, it runs a final
    check on whether the candidate solution also satisfies the semi-infinite
    condition (which implies :math:`dS/do\to0` as :math:`o\to\infty`).

def inverse(o, S):
    r"""
    Solve the inverse problem.

    Given a function `S` of `r` and `t`, and scalars :math:`S_i`, :math:`S_b`
    and :math:`o_b`, finds a positive function `D` of the values of `S` such
    that:

    .. math:: \begin{cases} \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial t} =
        \dfrac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(D\left(S\right)\dfrac{\partial S}
        {\partial r}\right) & r>r_b(t),t>0\\
        S(r, 0) = S_i & r>0 \\
        S(r_b(t), t) = S_b & t>0 \\
        r_b(t) = o_b\sqrt t
        \end{cases}

    `S` is input via its values on a finite set of points expressed in terms of
    the Boltzmann variable. Problems in radial coordinates are not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    o : numpy.array_like, shape (n,)
        Points where `S` is known, expressed in terms of the Boltzmann
        variable. Must be strictly increasing.

    S : numpy.array_like, shape (n,)
        Values of the solution at `o`. Must be monotonic (either non-increasing
        or non-decreasing) and ``S[-1]`` must be :math:`S_i`.

    Returns
    -------
    D : callable
        Twice-differentiable function that maps the range of `S` to positive
        values. It can be called as ``D(S)`` to evaluate it at `S`. It can
        also be called as ``D(S, n)`` with `n` equal to 1 or 2, in which case
        the first `n` derivatives of the function evaluated at the same `S` are
        included (in order) as additional return values. While mathematically a
        scalar function, `D` operates in a vectorized fashion with the same
        semantics when `S` is a `numpy.ndarray`.

    --------
    o

    Notes
    -----
    An `o` function of `S` is constructed by interpolating the input data with
    a PCHIP monotonic cubic spline. The function `D` is then constructed by
    applying the expressions that result from solving the Boltzmann-transformed
    equation for `D`.

    Depending on the number of points, the returned `D` may take orders of
    magnitude more time to be evaluated than an analytic function. In that
    case, you may notice that solvers work significantly slower when called
    with this `D`.
