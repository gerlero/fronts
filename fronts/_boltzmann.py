def ode(D, radial=False):
    r"""
    Transform the PDE into an ODE.

    Given a positive function `D` and coordinate unit vector
    :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}`, transform the partial differential equation
    (PDE) in which `S` is the unknown function of `r` and `t`:

    .. math:: \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial t} =
        \nabla\cdot\left[D\left(S\right)\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial r}
        \mathbf{\hat{r}}\right]

    into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) where `S` is an unknown
    function of the Boltzmann variable `o`.

    This function returns the `fun` and `jac` callables that may be used to
    solve the ODE with the solvers included with SciPy (`scipy.integrate`
    module). The second-order ODE is expressed as a system of first-order ODEs
    with independent variable `o` where ``y[0]`` in `fun` and `jac` correspond
    to the value of the function `S` itself and ``y[1]`` to its first
    derivative :math:`dS/do`.

    `fun` and `jac` support both non-vectorized usage (where their first
    argument is a float) as well as vectorized usage (when `numpy.ndarray`
    objects are passed as both arguments).

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : callable
        Twice-differentiable function that maps the range of `S` to positive
        values. It can be called as ``D(S)`` to evaluate it at `S`. It can
        also be called as ``D(S, n)`` with `n` equal to 1 or 2, in which case
        the first `n` derivatives of the function evaluated at the same `S` are
        included (in order) as additional return values. While mathematically a
        scalar function, `D` operates in a vectorized fashion with the same
        semantics when `S` is a `numpy.ndarray`.
    radial : {False, 'cylindrical', 'spherical'}, optional
        Choice of coordinate unit vector :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}`. Must be one
        of the following:

            * `False` (default)
                :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}` is any coordinate unit vector in
                rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates, or an axial unit vector in
                a cylindrical coordinate system
            * ``'cylindrical'``
                :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}` is the radial unit vector in a
                cylindrical coordinate system
            * ``'spherical'``
                :math:`\mathbf{\hat{r}}` is the radial unit vector in a
                spherical coordinate system

    Returns
    -------
    fun : callable
        Function that returns the right-hand side of the system. The calling
        signature is ``fun(o, y)``.
    jac : callable
        Function that returns the Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side of the
        system. The calling signature is ``jac(o, y)``.

    Solution

    Notes
    -----
    If `radial` is not `False`, the PDE is undefined at :math:`r=0`, and
    therefore the returned ODE is also undefined for :math:`o=0`.
