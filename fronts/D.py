    Return a constant `D` function.

    Given a positive constant `D`, returns the function `D`:

    .. math:: D(S) = D

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : float
        A positive constant.

    Returns
    -------
    D : callable
        Function that maps any value of `S` to the given constant. It can be
        called as ``D(S)`` to obtain the value. It can also be called as
        ``D(S, n)`` with `n` equal to 1 or 2, in which case the first `n`
        derivatives of the function, which are always zero, are included (in

        function, `D` operates in a vectorized fashion with the same semantics
        when `S` is a `numpy.ndarray`.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is not particularly useful: a constant `D` will turn a
    diffusion problem into a linear one, which has an exact solution and no
    numerical solvers are necessary. However, it is provided here given that it
    is the simplest supported function.

    r"""
    Return a Van Genuchten moisture diffusivity function.

    Given the parameters :math:`K_s`, :math:`\alpha`, `m`, `l`, :math:`S_r` and
    :math:`S_s`, the Van Genuchten moisture diffusivity function `D`
    is defined as:

    .. math:: D(S)=\frac{(1-m)K_s}{\alpha m (S_s-S_r)}
        S_e^{(l-\frac{1}{m})}\left((1-S_e^\frac{1}{m})^{-m} +
        (1-S_e^\frac{1}{m})^m - 2 \right)

    where:

    .. math:: S_e = \frac{S-S_r}{S_s-S_r}

    and `S` is the saturation (or moisture content).

    In common usage, the `m` parameter is replaced with an `n` parameter so
    that :math:`m=1-\tfrac{1}{n}`. This function supports either parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : float, optional
        `n` parameter in the Van Genuchten model. Must be >1. You must pass
        either `n` or `m` (but not both).
    m : float, optional
        `m` parameter in the Van Genucthen model. Must be strictly between 0
        and 1. You must pass either `n` or `m` (but not both).
    l : float, optional
        Pore connectivity parameter. The default is 0.5. Must be strictly
        between 0 and 1.
    alpha : float, optional
        :math:`\alpha` parameter of the Van Genucthen model. The default is 1.
        Must be positive.
    Ks : float, optional
        :math:`K_s`, the hydraulic conductivity when saturated. The default is
        1. Must be positive.
    S_range : (float, float), optional
        the tuple (:math:`S_r`, :math:`S_s`), where :math:`S_r` is the minimum
        (or residual) saturation and :math:`S_s` the maximum saturation. The
        default is (0, 1). :math:`S_s` must be greater than :math:`S_r`.

    Returns
    -------
    D : callable
        Twice-differentiable function that maps values of `S` in the open
        interval (:math:`S_r`, :math:`S_s`) to positive values. It can be
        called as ``D(S)`` to evaluate it at `S`. It can  also be called as
        ``D(S, n)`` with `n` equal to 1 or 2, in which case the first `n`
        derivatives of the function evaluated at the same `S` are included (in
        order) as additional return values. While mathematically a scalar
        function, `D` operates in a vectorized fashion with the same semantics
        when `S` is a `numpy.ndarray`.

    Notes
    -----
    The expression used is the one found in Van Genuchten's original paper [1],
    but with the addition of the optional `l` parameter.

def richards(K, C):

    Return a moisture diffusivity function for a Richards equation problem.

    Given the functions `K` and `C`, returns the function:

    .. math:: D(S) = \frac{K(S)}{C(S)}

    This function helps the conversion of horizontal Richards equation problems
    (for which those two functions are parameters) into moisture diffusivity
    problems that can be solved using this library.

    Parameters
    ----------
    K : callable
        Hydraulic conductivity function, defined in terms of saturation. A
        twice-differentiable function that maps values of `S` to positive
        values. It can be called as ``K(S)`` to evaluate it at `S`. It can also
        be called as ``K(S, n)`` with `n` equal to 1 or 2, in which case the
        first `n` derivatives of the function evaluated at the same `S` are
        included (in order) as additional return values. While mathematically a
        scalar function, `K` operates in a vectorized fashion with the same
        semantics when `S` is a `numpy.ndarray`.
    C : callable
        Capillary capacity function, defined in terms of saturation. A
        twice-differentiable function that maps values of `S` to positive
        values. It can be called as ``C(S)`` to evaluate it at `S`. It can also
        be called as ``C(S, n)`` with `n` equal to 1 or 2, in which case the
        first `n` derivatives of the function evaluated at the same `S` are

    D : callable
        Twice-differentiable function that maps values of `S` in the domains of
        both `K` and `C` to positive values. It can be called as ``D(S)`` to
