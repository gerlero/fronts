def constant(D0):
    r"""
    Return a constant `D` function.

    Given :math:`D_0`, returns the function `D`:

    .. math:: D(\theta) = D_0

    Parameters
    ----------
    D0 : float
        :math:`D_0`, a positive constant

    Returns
    -------
    D : callable
        Function to evaluate :math:`D` and its derivatives:

            *   ``D(theta)`` evaluates and returns :math:`D` at ``theta``
            *   ``D(theta, 1)`` returns both the value of :math:`D` and its
                first derivative at ``theta``
            *   ``D(theta, 2)`` returns the value of :math:`D`, its first
                derivative, and its second derivative at ``theta``

        In all cases, the argument ``theta`` may be a single float or a NumPy
        array.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is not particularly useful: a constant `D` will turn a
    diffusion problem into a linear one, which has an exact solution and no
    numerical solvers are necessary. However, it is provided here given that it
    is the simplest supported function.

def from_expr(expr, vectorized=True, max_derivatives=2):
    """
    Create a `D` function from a SymPy-compatible expression.

    Parameters
    ----------
    expr : `sympy.Expression` or str or float
        SymPy-compatible expression containing up to one free symbol.
    vectorized : bool, optional
        Whether the returned `D` must be compatible with a solver that uses
        vectorized calls.

        If True (default), the first argument passed to `D` may always be
        either a float or a NumPy array. However, if False, calls as
        ``D(theta, 1)`` or ``D(theta, 2)`` will assume that ``theta`` is a
        single float, which may allow for optimizations that speed up the
        evaluations required by a solver that does not use vectorized calls.

        Note that, regardless of this setting, calls to `D` that do not ask for
        any derivatives (i.e., calls as ``D(theta)``) will always take floats
        and arrays interchangeably. This behavior ensures that `D` is always
        compatible with the solution classes.
    max_derivatives : int, optional
        Highest-order derivative of `D` that may be required. Can be 0, 1 or 2.
        The default is 2.

    Returns
    -------
    D : callable
        Function to evaluate :math:`D` and its derivatives:

            *   ``D(theta)`` evaluates and returns :math:`D` at ``theta``
            *   If `max_derivatives` >= 1, ``D(theta, 1)`` returns both the
                value of :math:`D` and its first derivative at ``theta``
            *   If `max_derivatives` is 2, ``D(theta, 2)`` returns the value of
                :math:`D`, its first derivative, and its second derivative at
                ``theta``
        
        If `vectorized` is True, the argument ``theta`` may be a single float
        or a NumPy array in all cases. If `vectorized` is False, ``theta`` may
        be either a float or an array when `D` is called as ``D(theta)``, but
        it must be a float otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    Users will rarely need to call this function, as all built-in solver
    functions already do so themselves when they receive an expression as `D`.

def richards(C, kr, Ks=None, k=None, nu=1e-6, g=9.81):
    r"""
    Return a moisture diffusivity function for a Richards equation problem.

    Given `K_S` and the functions `C` and :math:`k_r` (whose argument is either
    water content or saturation), returns the function:

    .. math:: D(\theta) = \frac{K_S k_r(\theta)}{C(\theta)}

    This function helps transform problems of the horizontal Richards equation
    (for which :math:`K_S`, :math:`k_r`, and `C` are known parameters) into
    problems of the moisture diffusivity equation that can be solved with this
    library.

    Parameters
    ----------
    C : callable
        Capillary capacity function (also known as hydraulic capacity
        function). A twice-differentiable function that maps values of
        :math:`\theta` to positive values. It can be called as ``C(theta)`` to
        evaluate it at ``theta``. It can also be called as ``C(theta, n)`` with
        ``n`` equal to 1 or 2, in which case the first ``n`` derivatives of the
        function evaluated at the same ``theta`` are included (in order) as
        additional return values. While mathematically a scalar function, `C`
        operates in a vectorized fashion with the same semantics when ``theta``
        is a `numpy.ndarray`.
    kr : callable
        :math:`k_r`, the relative permeability function (also known as relative
        conductivity function). A twice-differentiable function that maps
        values of :math:`\theta` to positive values (usually between 0 and 1).
        It can be called as ``kr(theta)`` to evaluate it at ``theta``. It can
        also be called as ``kr(theta, n)`` with ``n`` equal to 1 or 2, in which
        case the first ``n`` derivatives of the function evaluated at the same
        ``theta`` are included (in order) as additional return values. While
        mathematically a scalar function, `kr` operates in a vectorized fashion
        with the same semantics when ``theta`` is a `numpy.ndarray`.
    Ks : None or float, optional
        :math:`K_S`, the saturated hydraulic conductivity. Must be positive. If
        neither `Ks` nor `k` are given, the saturated hydraulic conductivity is
        assumed to be 1.
    k : None or float, optional
        Intrinsic permeability of the porous medium. Can be given in place of
        `Ks`, which results in the saturated hydraulic conductivity being
        computed using :math:`K_S = kg/\nu`. Must be positive.
    nu : float, optional
        :math:`\nu`, the kinematic viscosity of the wetting fluid. Only used if
        `k` is passed instead of `Ks`. Must be positive. Defaults to 1e-6,
        approximately the kinematic viscosity of water at 20Â°C in SI units.
    g : float, optional
        Magnitude of the gravitational acceleration. Only used if `k` is passed
        instead of `Ks`. Must be positive. Defaults to 9.81, the gravity of
        Earth in SI units.

    Returns
    -------
    D : callable
        Function to evaluate :math:`D` and its derivatives:

            *   ``D(theta)`` evaluates and returns :math:`D` at ``theta``
            *   ``D(theta, 1)`` returns both the value of :math:`D` and its
                first derivative at ``theta``
            *   ``D(theta, 2)`` returns the value of :math:`D`, its first
                derivative, and its second derivative at ``theta``

        In all cases, the argument ``theta`` may be a single float or a NumPy
        array.

    Parameters
